After making any code changes, you MUST:
1. Stage the modified files (`git add`)
2. Commit with a clear message that summarises what was done (`git commit -m "..."`)
3. Push to origin (`git push origin main`) if the user has push access, or inform them to push via GitHub Desktop

Never leave edits uncommitted. The user expects all changes to be committed to the repository.
